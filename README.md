# liveCurrencyConverter
Converts currency using live exchange rate

You will need a php processor for this because it has a php file which the ajax is loading data from which i turn gets json data from url api.
I tried getting the json directly without using php, but the api provider didnt support cors. Im sorry for that but if have a fix for that please do so.
